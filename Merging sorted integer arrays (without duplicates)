//Task
//Write a function that merges two sorted arrays into a single one. The arrays only contain integers. 
//Also, the final outcome must be sorted and not have any duplicate.

//Answer
function mergeArrays(a, b) {
  let joinArr = a.concat(b);
  let sortedArr = joinArr.sort((a, b) => a - b)
  return [...new Set(sortedArr)];

}

//Other Answer with spread op to join arrays
function mergeArrays(a, b) {
  let joinArr = [...a,...b]
  let joinNSort = joinArr.sort((a, b) => a - b)
  return noDup = [...new Set(joinNSort)]
}
