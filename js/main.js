//CODEWARS FOR 100DEVS CLASSES!!


//Class 36 - 9/26/23

//Task (7kyu)
// You are given an odd-length array of integers, in which all of them are the same, except for one single number.

// Complete the method which accepts such an array, and returns that single different number.

// The input array will always be valid! (odd-length >= 3)

//Answer
function stray(numbers) {
    for(let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++)
      if(numbers.indexOf(numbers[i]) === numbers.lastIndexOf(numbers[i])){
        return numbers[i];
      }
   }


// someone else's answer I get now

function strayDos = nums => nums.reduce((a, b) => a ^ b);

//     Your function takes two arguments:

//     current father's age (years)
//     current age of his son (years)
// Ð¡alculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son (or in how many years he will be twice as old). The answer is always greater or equal to 0, no matter if it was in the past or it is in the future.



//Answer

function twiceAsOld(dad, son){
    return Math.abs(dad - son * 2);
}

//Task (8kyu)
// In this Kata we are passing a number (n) into a function.

// Your code will determine if the number passed is even (or not).

// The function needs to return either a true or false.

// Numbers may be positive or negative, integers or floats.

// Floats with decimal part non equal to zero are considered UNeven for this kata.


//Answer
function testEven(n) {
    return n % 2 === 0
   }
