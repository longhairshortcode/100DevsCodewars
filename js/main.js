//CODEWARS FOR 100DEVS CLASSES!!


//Class 36 - 9/26/23

//Task (7kyu)
// You are given an odd-length array of integers, in which all of them are the same, except for one single number.

// Complete the method which accepts such an array, and returns that single different number.

// The input array will always be valid! (odd-length >= 3)

//Answer
function stray(numbers) {
    for(let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++)
      if(numbers.indexOf(numbers[i]) === numbers.lastIndexOf(numbers[i])){
        return numbers[i];
      }
   }


// someone else's answer I get now

function strayDos = nums => nums.reduce((a, b) => a ^ b);

//Class 36 - 9/26/23 

//Task (8kyu)
//     Your function takes two arguments:

//     current father's age (years)
//     current age of his son (years)
// Ð¡alculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son (or in how many years he will be twice as old). The answer is always greater or equal to 0, no matter if it was in the past or it is in the future.



//Answer

function twiceAsOld(dad, son){
    return Math.abs(dad - son * 2);
}

//Class 36 - 9/26/23 

//Task (8kyu)
// In this Kata we are passing a number (n) into a function.

// Your code will determine if the number passed is even (or not).

// The function needs to return either a true or false.

// Numbers may be positive or negative, integers or floats.

// Floats with decimal part non equal to zero are considered UNeven for this kata.


//Answer
function testEven(n) {
    return n % 2 === 0
   }


//Class 36 - 9/27/23 
//Task (8kyu)

// In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

// Examples
// makeNegative(1);    // return -1
// makeNegative(-5);   // return -5
// makeNegative(0);    // return 0
// makeNegative(0.12); // return -0.12
// Notes
// The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
// Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.

//Answer:

let isItNeg = num => num < 0 ? num : num * -1





//Class 36 - 9/27/23 
//Task (8kyu)

// Complete the function that takes two integers (a, b, where a < b) and return an array of all integers between the input parameters, including them.

// For example:

// a = 1
// b = 4
// --> [1, 2, 3, 4]


//Answer

function between(a, b) {
  let theArr = []
  for (let i = a; i <= b; i++){
  theArr.push(i)
} return theArr;
}



//Task
// Build a function that returns an array of integers from n to 1 where n>0.

// Example : n=5 --> [5,4,3,2,1]

//Answer

const reverseSeq = n => {
  let myArr = []
  for (let i = n; i > 0; i--){
    myArr.push(i)
  }
  return myArr;
}

//task
//Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, 
//they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the 
//flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd 
//number of petals it means they are in love.

//Write a function that will take the number of petals of each 
//flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.

//answer

function lovefunc(flower1, flower2){
  if (flower1 % 2 === 0 && flower2 % 2 !== 0){
    return true;
  }else if (flower2 % 2 === 0 && flower1 % 2 !== 0){
    return true;
  }else{
    return false;
  }
