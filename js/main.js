// In this Kata we are passing a number (n) into a function.

// Your code will determine if the number passed is even (or not).

// The function needs to return either a true or false.

// Numbers may be positive or negative, integers or floats.

// Floats with decimal part non equal to zero are considered UNeven for this kata.

// In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

// makeNegative(1);    // return -1
// makeNegative(-5);   // return -5
// makeNegative(0);    // return 0
// makeNegative(0.12); // return -0.12
// Notes
// The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
// Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.
