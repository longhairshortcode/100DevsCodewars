//Task
//An AI has infected a text with a character!!
//This text is now fully mutated to this character.
//If the text or the character are empty, return an empty string.
//There will never be a case when both are empty as nothing is going on!!
//Note: The character is a string of length 1 or an empty string.
//Example
//text before = "abc"
//character   = "z"
//text after  = "zzz"
